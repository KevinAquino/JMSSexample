# JMSSexample

This code here is an example of how to load in NIFTI data, then display a slice of the image. This requires the usual scientific packages in python:

- sciPy
- numPy
- matplotlib

And also requires a nifti package:

- nibabel (http://nipy.org/nibabel/) 

To run this code i have included a simple anatomy (a very low resolution anatomical file) so simply run this within this folder to check out the outputs!

toy_example.py 

This of course is just a way to read in the images you can also use a more sophisticated program to navigate through the images: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron (and there are many more programs!).
